Woosh aims to onboard web2 users into the world of crypto by providing a user-friendly and intuitive cash app. It's simple enough for web2 users and functional enough for web3 users. Little to zero knowledge of crypto, Ethereum, or gas fees is necessary for the user to get started. We aimed to make this cash app as simple as humanly possible. Imagine Web3 + Venmo, with Woosh, you can follow your friends, request/send crypto, customize your profile and have peace of mind that every transaction you complete is with a verified human. No bots allowed!

This platform allows users to stake crypto for a duration of time to support their favorite artists. Once the duration of time has passed the users will receive their staking and the creator will receive the yield. As a prize for fulfilling the staking period, the user will recieve an NFT, which is proof of support.
